# Electronic-Component-Test-Status-Monitoring-System-LabVIEW-
Typical use cases: device characterization, long-duration stress tests, power-cycling related electrical tracking, and multi-DUT screening where repeatable, unattended measurement is required.

A LabVIEW-based monitoring and data-logging system for electronic component testing, built around Keithley 2470 / 2450 SourceMeters and a Keithley 3706A System Switch (switching/scanning). The software automates multi-channel DUT scanning, captures voltage/current from both SMUs, optionally collects temperature channels, and stores time-stamped records for reliability and degradation experiments.
